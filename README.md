Goal:
To provide players with a better gaming experience than previously possible. We aim to facilitate quick game setup and tracking of wins/losses.

Currently there are two modes; Random and Ordered.

Random chooses any combination with little regard to the necessary win conditions.

Ordered chooses combinations that are feasible and allow the player the possibility of winning based on attributes required etc.
